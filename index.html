        <p>
          I am full stack web developer, community organizer, and ffarmer, using
          my skills for justice, sustainabiilty, and liberation. For the last 10
          years I have been involved in social action through community
          organizing, building political campaigns, and managing projects that
          solve the greatest challenges of our time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a systems thinker, I'm excited about problem-solving and figuring
          out how to make the many moving pieces and processes flow together
          seamlessly. I excel in coordinating groups of people in finding shared
          purpose and goals, then creating a road map for getting there.
        </p>
        <p>
          From agile development to strategic campaign organizing to farm
          planning, I'm passionate about leveraging my passion and skills for
          powerful, collaborative, world-changing work.
